        <p>Numerology can loosely be described as the sister study to Astrology. Much like astrology, Numerology is a form of divination.</p>
        <p>The difference between the two practices is that Astrology focuses on the study and interpretation of the Planets and the solar system while Numerology is rooted in the study of.... you guessed it, numbers! </p>
        <p>Many numerologists believe that by and large, our world is made up of numbers. They believe that through studying the 'language' of numbers, we can reveal deeper insights about our selves and the world we live in.</p>
        <p>Practicing Numerology consists of using an alphanumeric cipher to assign numbers to letters in order to calculate the numeric value of different words, phrases, names, and/or anything else that represents you or is personally significant to your life.</p>
        <p>While there is certainly much controversy surrounding the study, the rich history behind the practice is quite fascinating nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the practice of associating numbers with letters goes back quite a long time. One example of a numerological system, called "Gematria", which is a Jewish tradition of assigning meaning to words according to their numerical value, dates all the way back to antiquity. </p>
        <p>Since then, many cultures around the world have adopted their own numerological systems. </p>
        <p>Today, the most common form of Numerology in the west is known as "Pythagorean Numerology," which is a variety of numerology popularized by a well-known Greek mathematician and physicist. You may remember him better for his contributions to geometry, mainly, the "Pythagorean Theorem" or (a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>) </p>
        <p>In this Life Path Calculator that I have created, I have utilized the Pythagorean numerological system, which is just one of many intriguing numerological systems. If you enjoy learning the information I have shared with you about Pythagorean numerology, I encourage you to explore some of the other well-known systems, as each system offers unique traditions, perspectives, and knowledge to share with you. Even for those of you who do not necessarily believe in divination or in spiritual practices, Numerology can be a wonderful pragmatic tool, and I believe it offers an abundance of wisdom and insight that anyone can benefit from no matter who you are or what you believe! </p>

        <p>In regards to Astrology, many of you may be familiar with your "Sun Sign" (Taurus, Gemini, Scorpio, etc). just as you have your sun sign in Astrology, you have a 'Life Path Number' in Numerology. Also, just like you have a birth chart in Astrology (sun sign, moon sign, rising sign) which is calculated from your date of birth, similarly, you have a numerology chart which holds not on</p>

        <p> But what's it all about anyway? When you lookup "Numerology" on the internet, there is an almost overwhelming abundance of information surrounding Numerology and what it really means. Although there are a number of popular Numerology systems which originate from different cultures around the world that each have their own unique ciphers, charts, and interpretations, the underlying theme behind the practice remains more or less the same.</p>
        
        <p>Numerology is a practice which involves the study and interpretation of numbers. Many people who practice numerology strongly believe that our world is largely made up of numbers, and that in studying the 'language' of numbers, we can reveal deeper insights about our selves and the world we live in. Practicing Numerology consists of using an alphanumeric cipher to assign numbers to letters in order to calculate the numeric value of different words, phrases, names, and/or anything else that represents you or is personally significant to your life. There are many critics who claim that Numerology is nothing but 'pseudo-science.' On the other end of the spectrum, however, there are many people who strongly believe in Numerology, some even believe that numerology can reveal hidden elements of a person's destiny.</p>

        <p>Whether or not you are a believer, the tradition of interpreting and associating numbers with letters goes back quite a long time and the rich history behind the practice is rather fascinating nonetheless.</p>
